                    <p>I primarily cover Ball State football and basketball while occasionally writing on minor Cardinals sports and helping with prep events. As one of three sports reporters at The Star Press, I help plan and execute the section daily. I'm also responsible for posting our section's content to Facebook and Twitter.</p>

                    <p>I worked for 10 weeks as a Pulliam Fellow on Indy Star's digital desk. There I was fortunate to work across several different areas of the newsroom. I helped manage social media accounts, led in-depth analytics projects and produced stories for news, sports and features.</p>
