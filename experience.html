                    <p>I cover Ball State sports for The Star Press, a Gannett paper located in Muncie, Indiana. It's a part-time job until I graduate, then I'll start working full-time. For now, I'm producing about five pieces of content per week.</p>

                  <h5>The Indianapolis Star<div class="mobilecategory">Experience</div></h5>
                    <p>I worked for 10 weeks as a Pulliam Fellow on Indy Star's digital desk. There I was fortunate to work across several different areas of the newsroom. I helped manage social media accounts, led in-depth analytics projects and produced content all the while.</p>

                  <h5>The Fort Wayne News-Sentinel <div class="mobilecategory">Experience</div></h5>
                    <p>I wrote 25 articles over the span of 10 weeks with the <a href="http://news-sentinel.com/" target="blank">News-Sentinel</a> sports staff. In addition to daily reporting, I helped develop an online design style using HTML and CSS. I also produced 20 photos, five videos, two graphics, two Google Maps and participated in two podcasts.</p>

                  <h5>The Ball State Daily News <div class="mobilecategory">Experience</div></h5>
                    <p>I held five positions with The Daily News before being named editor-in-chief of the student-run, award-winning print publication at Ball State University. I hired 20 paid editors and oversaw a staff of about 90 employees. Of course, that only lasted about six weeks. See: Muncie Star Press.</p>
