                    <p>I'm working for my hometown paper as a digital sports producer. I run social media accounts, create #content and help cover everything from the Colts to the Fever and Notre Dame football. I first got my feet in the door at IndyStar as a Pulliam fellow in 2015.</p>

                  <h5>The Muncie Star Press<div class="mobilecategory">Experience</div></h5>
                    <p>I covered Ball State sports and helped with prep coverage. As one of three sports reporters at The Star Press, I helped plan and execute the section daily. I was hired straight from Ball State, where I graduated with a journalism degree.</p>

                  <h5>The Fort Wayne News-Sentinel <div class="mobilecategory">Experience</div></h5>
                    <p>I wrote 25 articles over the span of 10 weeks with the <a href="http://news-sentinel.com/" target="blank">News-Sentinel</a> sports staff. I worked part-time and spent the rest of my days trying to learn HTML.</p>

                  <h5>The Ball State Daily News <div class="mobilecategory">Experience</div></h5>
                    <p>I held five positions with The Daily News before being named editor-in-chief of the student-run, award-winning print publication my senior year. I hired 20 paid editors and oversaw a staff of about 90. I led our transition to digital.</p>

                    <p>After creating Ball State's Online News Association student group, I led it for one year. We brought several pro journalists to campus and organized a series of workshops. Can't wait for ONA17 in DC.</p>
