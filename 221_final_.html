				<h1>Facelift</h1>
				<h3>How The Promenade is bringing a new culture to Ball State's Village</h3>
				<h5>By Dakota Crawford</h5>

					<p>It’s just not the same in The Village anymore.<p>University Avenue is visibly different now that the <a href="http://villagepromenade.com/" target="blank">Village Promenade</a> stands four stories tall over its south sidewalk. Businesses and other homes in the area look a little less appealing in comparison to the freshly-built luxury apartment complex.</p> 

<p>Local business owners speculate that traditional mom-and-pop places in the Village could go under as new, fresh shops open up in the area. <a href="https://twitter.com/bsu_dillstreet" target="blank">Dill Street Bar and Grill,</a> once a mainstay for Village regulars, has seen its business dwindle since Brothers Bar and Grill opened in the first floor of the Promenade building.</p><p>There is a bright side for other businesses, though. Andy Goth, owner of Sunsations Tanning located across from the Promenade, received a $12,000 paycheck to make his tanning beds available to residents in the new apartments.</p><p>“[The Promenade] is going to spend some money on bulbs and electricity and they’re going to take up some space,” Goth said. “So in a way, they’re going to spend that money anyway. I’m not charging much more than what they would pay anyway.”</p><p>Goth said the Promenade was the first apartment complex in the area to use an actual tanning salon for its amenities. University Estates, an apartment complex on the North Side of Bethel Avenue, now uses Sunsations for its residents as well.</p><p>Hopeful the deal will increase volume, create hype and spread his name, Goth is looking to shift his business model a bit. In the future, he hopes to find additional apartment complexes that will pay to use his tanning beds. He said none are interested at this time.</p>

					<p>Goth is also a 50 percent owner of The Cup, a four-year-old coffee shop on the west end of the Village. His business partner Martin George said the Promenade has its flaws, but its helped to get coffee drinkers in his door, too.</p><p>“It’s about the same as it was a year ago,” Martin said. “We’re looking across the street at a row of empty storefronts, which is pretty much where we were at before the old building was torn down.”</p><p>The corner across from The Cup used to be home to Dill Street. It was in a much smaller building that didn’t stand out from the rest of the Village quite like The Promenade does now. But George sees them nearly the same -- as buildings that are struggling to draw businesses into their space.</p>

					<p>Other than a <a href="http://www.letsspoonfroyo.com/" target="blank">Frozen Yogurt</a> shop set to open in January, there isn’t a business opening any time in the near future. Despite some tangible benefits from the Promenade, Martin is skeptical about the long term sustainability of the massive building.</p><p>He’s lived in Muncie for 30 years. To Martin, the Village has been changing for a long time. The hulking Promenade building, though, is changing how Muncie homes are being rented to college students unlike any before it. Goth owns several properties throughout the area, and he said while some people won’t be swayed away from renting homes, Promenade is going to shift the market a bit.</p><p>“On Jackson [Street,] and south of Jackson, for example, I think those houses are taking a hit,” he said. “Those houses got a lot less attractive because of the Promenade. It was bound to happen. You’ve got the Village Promenade and the Grove now and people are coming closer to the Village.”</p><p>As big housing companies continue to move into the area, local businesses and homeowners are forced to adjust. Some, like Goth, are making out better than others. No matter how the market changes, though, Goth said one thing will remain true.</p><p>“It all boils down to what people want,” he said.</p>
