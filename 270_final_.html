				<h3>How a United States Air Force veteran is leading the Muncie Mission</h3>
				<h5>By Dakota Crawford</h5>

					<p>Just three months working as executive director at the Muncie Mission has been enough time for Frank Baldwin. After going through a homeless spell of about 1 year in the streets of Seattle, Washington, Baldwin can relate to the men and families that come to the Muncie shelter for help.</p> 

<p>“I know that look in there eyes,” Baldwin said. “I’ve experienced it. So, that’s why I’m here. This is the greatest thing I’ve ever done.”</p> 

<p>The United States Air Force veteran was stationed in Anchorage, Alaska during the Cold War. After a couple years in school following the end of his service, Baldwin decided to move with his family to Colorado. The retired veteran packed up in a retired U-Haul truck and started the journey to be closer to his family.</p> 

<p>After some time on the road the family decided to pull off in Seattle for a night. When they woke up, excited to get back on the road, they realized there was no truck in sight. They realized everything was gone.</p> 

<p>“I found myself on the streets of Seattle wearing everything that I owned,” Baldwin said.</p> 

<p>Though Baldwin’s homeless situation was founded primarily on misfortune, there is a striking similarity among the veteran population in Muncie, Ind. 12 percent of the veteran population in Muncie was unemployed in 2013, compared to just 7 percent in the state of Indiana.</p> 

<p>The Muncie Mission’s resident population has remained pretty consistent in size over the last five years. There has been an increased portion that is under the age of 25, though. And a lot of them are veterans, Baldwin said. He could only speculate as to why the former servicemen are finding themselves in tough situations when they return home.</p> 
					<blockquote>
						“Maybe [their] family environment isn’t intact. Maybe he doesn’t have a family support system at all,” Baldwin said. “If I was over there and seeing this kind of violence every day, and then wondering ‘What is this for?’ I would think that is hard.”
					</blockquote>
<p>There are handful of programs in Muncie focused on helping veterans out of tough times. One, that works directly with the Muncie Mission, is the Muncie Stand Down. Last month the Mission hosted the event that provided free food, haircuts and several other services to any veteran that presented their DD 214 at the registration booth.</p> 

<p>The small piece of paper, for many veterans, is the only proof they have of serving in the United States military. Baldwin knows just how much that piece of paper means, because he lost it with everything else he owned when the U-Haul truck was stolen from him in Seattle. A group of individuals involved with the Stand Down went to the trouble of getting Baldwin that piece of paper back.</p> 

<p>“I just wanted proof,” he said. “Now I have it again.” 
<p>Baldwin said working within the veteran community is especially rewarding because he gets to chip in to a community that is always active in helping its less fortunate. There are no socioeconomic dividing lines among veterans, Baldwin said. He said the veterans that have come through the Muncie Mission of late are especially close.</p> 

<p>“When you’re in the military, you’re brothers,” he said.</p> 

<p>Not even the strongest of brotherhoods can overcome low incomes and struggles that are affecting many veterans today, though. The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness found that 70 percent of veterans experiencing homelessness also suffer from substance abuse disorders.</p> 

<p>Baldwin sees a lot of individuals fighting through drug abuse at the Mission, which is why he offers a 12-month addiction recovery program that is based on positive reinforcement. The more successful individuals in the program are, the better their facilities are. They gain access to nicer dormitory style rooms, better recreation areas and a full gym.</p> 

<p>There isn’t a direct correlation between veterans and drug abuse at the Mission, Baldwin said, but he knows it can be a problem among those with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The Army has recently adopted limitations on the duration of its opioid prescriptions to soldiers because of the growing problem, according to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.</p> 

<p>The rate of prescription drug abuse is higher among service members than in civilians, according to drugabuse.gov. The study found that 11 percent of servicemen reported misusing drugs compared to just 2 percent in 2002. It’s easy to forget the violence that veterans see on a daily basis when deployed. The pain they go through and the things they experience every day. It builds up.</p> 

<p>It can be hard for the average civilian to understand. But for a veteran like Baldwin, helping those who need it most comes naturally because he’s been there before.</p> 

<p>“We were moving up, and then this terrible event just derailed us,” Baldwin said. “It took us years to recover. You just felt so violated, and it messed with my head for a little while.</p> 

<p>“It’s really good to help those guys.”</p>
