                    <p>I wrote 25 articles over the span of 10 weeks with the <a href="http://news-sentinel.com/" target="blank">News-Sentinel</a> sports staff. In addition to daily reporting, I helped develop an online design style using HTML and CSS. I also produced 20 photos, five videos, two graphics, two Google Maps and participated in two podcasts.</p>

                    <p>I traveled to the 2014 Winter Olympics with BSU at The Games, a Ball State immersive learning class. We worked as freelance journalists. We did not, however, have any press passes. Instead we took the streets and wrote features. I was invited back to work as Lead Writer for <a href="http://attheindianafair.com/author/dakota-crawford/" target="blank">BSU journalism at the Fair</a> in the summer of 2014.</p>

                    <p>I've held five positions with the DN, including my current position as iDesk Editor. I create multimedia elements to compliment web articles and help manage <a href="http://www.ballstatedaily.com/" target="blank">online content.</a> As sports editor last spring I managed a staff of 10 writers and helped move the section toward longform writing. I've also held enterprise and football reporting positions.</p>
