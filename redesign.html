						<p>The athletic department depends on students to fund about $11 million of its budget through student fees, and those fees could continue to rise.</p><p>Last year the university collected $19,885,860 through its “student services fee,” which students pay in addition to base tuition. The fee for all students taking at least seven credit hours is $647 for the fall and spring semesters. It drops to $485 during the summer session.</p><p>A majority of student money collected through the fees -- 56 percent or about $11 million of it – went to athletics last year.</p>
