								<h5>More Than A Number</h5>
									<p>It’s 2009 and the falls are easy for Jonathan Newsome. Coming off a 101-tackle, 17-sack campaign as a senior at Glenville High School where he was team captain, he’s ready for the next step.</p>

								<h5>Chuck The Painter</h5>
								<p>Rows of towering food trailers hover over Main Street at the Indiana State Fairgrounds like small skyscrapers over a city block. There is little nostalgia in the vinyl-wrapped pre-fab buildings that continue to become more commonwith time.</p>

								<h5>Rising From Tragedy</h5>
								<p>It seems easy to be a good teammate, easy to help incoming freshmen make the transition to college life. From the outside, it even seems easy shooting 54 percent from the floor for an entire season. Easy, maybe, for someone who hasn't had her life turned upside-down.</p>

								<h5>Perfect</h5>
								<p>He wasn't actually perfect, as you'll see, but he's close. Though undersized, this kid can shoot the three-pointer really, really well.</p>
